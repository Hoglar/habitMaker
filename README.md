About this app.

Dependencies.
We start by installing lates version of node.js then expo.
Do the mobile need node to run?

What else do we need?
    -React navigation, This was a bit heavy, but liked it a bit, so were going for it.
    -propTypes, i will use this. Its a nice tool for keeping things clean.

    -We need to install  react-native-gesture-handler, react-native-reanimated, and react-native-screens

    assert?

    The app will be small sized so i wont be using redux.

expo may need some extra installations based on features i want to use.
